1) Principal Component Analysis (selected 150 components 95% variance).
	The following classifiers didn't seem to do well at all
2) Tried simple classifiers
	a) Logistic Regression
	b) Linear SVM
	c) Kernel SVM (RBF)
	d) Decision Trees (I forgot this)
	e) kNN
	f) Random Forests
3) Implemented feature selection using FEAST.
4) Also try XGBoost?
5) Logistic regression with L1, L2, elastic net regularization?
6) Selected patients so the classes are balanced
7) Question about double dipping (feature selection and then principal component analysis)
8) Picking RBF SVM based on initial assessment on F1 plots and need to tune the hyperparameters
