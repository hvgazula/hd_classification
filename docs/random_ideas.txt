1) Principal Component Analysis
2) Tried simple classifiers
	a) Logistic Regression
	b) Linear SVM
	c) Kernel SVM 
	d) Decision Trees
	e) kNN
	f) Random Forests
3) Need to look at FEAST to implement feature selection
4) Also try XGBoost
5) Logistic regression with L1, L2, elastic net regularization?
